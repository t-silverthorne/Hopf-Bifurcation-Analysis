# Hopf Bifurcation Analysis 

This repository contains code for the detecting and classifying Hopf bifurcations. Detection is handeled using a predictor-corrector method. Once a Hopf-bifurcation has been found, you can classify it using the first Lyapunov coefficient. 

The PC-method is pseudo arclength continuation. 

The Lyapunov coefficient is computed using automatic differentiation.
